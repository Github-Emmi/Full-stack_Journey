    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"local-library\",\n",
    "What it does: This is your project's name - like giving your application an official title.\n",
    "\n",
    "json\n",
    "\"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n",
    "What it does: Tracks your project's version number. This follows Semantic Versioning (Major.Minor.Patch).\n",

    "json\n",
    "\"description\": \"A community library management system\",\n",
    "What it does: Briefly explains what your project does - like a short elevator pitch.\n",

    "üåç Real-World Scenario:\n",
    "Think of package.json as a Restaurant Recipe Card:\n",
    "\n",
    "Name & Description = The dish name and description on the menu\n",
    "\n",
    "Version = Recipe version (1.0 = original, 1.1 = improved recipe)\n",
    "\n",
    "Main = The head chef who coordinates everything\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripts = Cooking instructions (\"bake at 350¬∞ for 30 mins\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies = Main ingredients (flour, eggs, sugar)\n",
    "\n",
    "DevDependencies = Kitchen tools (mixer, oven thermometer)\n",

    "üîÑ Core Logic Flow:\n",
    "Project Identification ‚Üí Name, version, description help others understand your project\n",
    "\n",
    "Entry Point ‚Üí When someone runs your app, it starts from server.js\n",
    "\n",
    "Command Shortcuts ‚Üí Scripts make complex commands simple to run\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency Management ‚Üí Ensures everyone has the same tools and ingredients\n",

    "Use npm update regularly to keep packages current\n",
    "\n",
    "Check node_modules folder - it contains all your downloaded packages\n",
    "\n",
    ".gitignore should include node_modules (it's like excluding the grocery store from your recipe card)\n",
