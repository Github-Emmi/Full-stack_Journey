    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Introduction to Express.js and Setting Up a Server\n",
    "### üéØ Objective:\n",
    "   **Learn the fundamentals of Express.js framework**\n",
    "    **Set up a basic Express.js server from scratch**\n",
    "    **Understand how the request-response cycle works in web development**\n",
    "    **Connect Express.js with MongoDB for full-stack applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "## ü§î What is Express.js?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Analogy: The Restaurant Kitchen**\n",
    "Think of Express.js as the kitchen and service staff in a restaurant:\n",
    "\n",
    "Restaurant\tWeb Application\tWhat They Do\n",
    "Customer\tClient (Browser)\tMakes requests (orders food)\n",
    "Waiter\tExpress.js\tTakes orders, coordinates with kitchen, serves food\n",
    "Kitchen\tYour Business Logic\tPrepares the food (processes data)\n",
    "Menu\tAPI Routes\tAvailable options the customer can choose\n",
    "Express.js is the waiter - it handles incoming requests, communicates with your business logic (kitchen), and delivers responses back to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical Definition:\n",
    "Express.js is a minimal, flexible Node.js web application framework that provides robust features for building web and mobile applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "// Plain Node.js - you have to do everything manually\n",
    "const http = require('http');\n",
    "\n",
    "const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n",
    "  // Manually parse URLs\n",
    "  if (req.url === '/books' && req.method === 'GET') {\n",
    "    // Manually set headers\n",
    "    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });\n",
    "    // Manually handle response\n",
    "    res.end(JSON.stringify(books));\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  // Repeat for every route... üò´\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "server.listen(3000);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Express.js:**\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "const express = require('express');\n",
    "const app = express();\n",
    "\n",
    "// Express handles the repetitive work for you\n",
    "app.get('/books', (req, res) => {\n",
    "  res.json(books); // So much simpler! üéâ\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "app.listen(3000);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Benefits:\n",
    "**Speed of Development** - Build APIs in hours, not days\n",
    "\n",
    "**Middleware Architecture** - Modular, reusable components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Robust Routing** - Clean, organized URL handling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Great for APIs** - Perfect foundation for MERN stack\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production Ready** - Used by Fortune 500 companies\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîÑ Understanding the Request-Response Cycle\n",
    "The \"Conversation\" Between Client and Server\n",
    "Imagine ordering food delivery:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` text\n",
    "YOU (Client) ‚Üí \"I want pizza\" (Request) \n",
    "    ‚Üí DELIVERY APP (Express.js) \n",
    "    ‚Üí PIZZA RESTAURANT (Your Code) \n",
    "    ‚Üí \"Here's your pizza\" (Response) \n",
    "    ‚Üí YOU receive pizza\n",
    "Technical Flow:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "``` text\n",
    "Browser Request \n",
    "    ‚Üí Express Server \n",
    "    ‚Üí Middleware Processing \n",
    "    ‚Üí Route Handler \n",
    "    ‚Üí Database Query (MongoDB) \n",
    "    ‚Üí Business Logic \n",
    "    ‚Üí Response Preparation \n",
    "    ‚Üí Browser Receives Response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visual Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "// Client makes request to: GET https://api.com/books/123\n",
    "\n",
    "// Express.js handles it step by step:\n",
    "app.get('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n",
    "  // 1. req.params = { id: '123' } (Express parsed this automatically)\n",
    "  // 2. Query database for book with ID 123\n",
    "  // 3. Process the data\n",
    "  // 4. res.json(book) sends response back to client\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "## üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Install Node.js Using NVM (Node Version Manager)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why NVM?** The \"Multiple Personalities\" for Projects\n",
    "Problem: Different projects need different Node.js versions, just like different recipes need specific ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without NVM:** You're stuck with one Node.js version for all projects\n",
    "**With NVM:** Switch between Node.js versions like changing TV channels\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation Guide:\n",
    "macOS/Linux:\n",
    "bash\n",
    "# Install NVM (Node Version Manager)\n",
    "curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash\n",
    "\n",
    "# Restart your terminal or run:\n",
    "source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version\n",
    "nvm install --lts\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use it as default\n",
    "nvm use --lts\n",
    "nvm alias default lts/*\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify installation\n",
    "node --version  # Should show version like v18.17.0\n",
    "npm --version   # Should show npm version like 9.6.7\n",
    "Windows:\n",
    "bash\n",
    "# Download from: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases\n",
    "# Run nvm-setup.exe\n",
    "\n",
    "# Then in command prompt:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "nvm install lts\n",
    "nvm use lts\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify\n",
    "node --version\n",
    "npm --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters:\n",
    "**Project Compatibility:** Old projects might break with new Node.js versions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Team Consistency:** Everyone uses the same version\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stability:** LTS versions are tested and reliable\n",
    "\n",
