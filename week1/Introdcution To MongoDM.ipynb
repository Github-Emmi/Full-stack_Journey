    "## Introduction to MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in the form of documents rather than tables, making it more flexible and scalable than traditional SQL-based relational databases. Unlike relational databases that use rows and columns, MongoDB organizes data into collections of documents that use BSON (Binary JSON) format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema-less: No predefined structure, allowing for more flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalable: Can handle large amounts of data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Performance: Optimized for fast reads and writes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed System: Supports replication and horizontal scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce platforms: Storing product details, orders, and user data.\n",
